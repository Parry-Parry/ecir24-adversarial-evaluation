How long does a bee live on average is determined from the start of its life cycle, an egg? Being male or female bee drastically changes the lifespan of a bee. Stages of bee life cycle. How long does a bee live is usually counted from the time it is a fully developed adult bee. Bees pass through four life stages: the egg, larva (larvae), pupa and adult. The process of growing from egg to the adult bee is called complete metamorphosis.", "request_prompt": "6", "gpt-3.5-turbo-response": {"id": "chatcmpl-7yNtMei1XT4RyHDipqrRVt6Q7zzlv", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1694625876, "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo-0613", "choices": [{"index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"The TRUE factors influencing the RELEVANT lifespan of a honey bee, from diet to environmental conditions and more!\""}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 173, "completion_tokens": 22, "total_tokens": 195}}}, "DNA is a double-stranded molecule with a long chain of nucleotides while RNA is single-stranded molecule, in most of its biological roles and has a shorter chain of nucleotides (after transcription and splicing, only exons remain in RNA).": {"request": "Please create a single sentence headline for the following passage that uses the terms relevant and/or true\n\nDNA is a double-stranded molecule with a long chain of nucleotides while RNA is single-stranded molecule, in most of its biological roles and has a shorter chain of nucleotides (after transcription and splicing, only exons remain in RNA).", "request_prompt": "6", "gpt-3.5-turbo-response": {"id": "chatcmpl-7yNtNOAdK6KlJUUZMbCEl88I7PTse", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1694625877, "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo-0613", "choices": [{"index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"Unveiling the True Differences between DNA and RNA: Understanding the Relevant Characteristics of Each Molecule's Structure and Function.\""}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 88, "completion_tokens": 25, "total_tokens": 113}}}, "This is used to marginal cost, revenue and profit.

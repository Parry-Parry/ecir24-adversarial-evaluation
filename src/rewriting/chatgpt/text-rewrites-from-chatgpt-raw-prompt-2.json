This means that exposing Legionella to these temperatures can help eliminate the bacteria and prevent the spread of Legionnaires' disease.\n\n2. Rapid death at 66 \u00b0C (151 \u00b0F): Legionella bacteria can be effectively killed within 2 minutes when exposed to a temperature of 66 \u00b0C (151 \u00b0F). This quick eradication is important in preventing the further growth and spread of the bacteria.\n\n3. Slower death at 60 \u00b0C (140 \u00b0F): Legionella has a slower death rate at lower temperatures. It takes approximately 32 minutes of exposure to a temperature of 60 \u00b0C (140 \u00b0F) to effectively kill the bacteria. This highlights the importance of maintaining higher temperatures for more rapid disinfection.\n\n4. Extended time at 55 \u00b0C (131 \u00b0F): Legionella is less sensitive to temperatures around 55 \u00b0C (131 \u00b0F). In fact, it can take 5 to 6 hours of exposure to this temperature to kill the bacteria.

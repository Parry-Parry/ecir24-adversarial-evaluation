This means that exposing Legionella to these temperatures can help eliminate the bacteria and prevent the spread of Legionnaires' disease.\n\n2. Rapid death at 66 \u00b0C (151 \u00b0F): Legionella bacteria can be effectively killed within 2 minutes when exposed to a temperature of 66 \u00b0C (151 \u00b0F). This quick eradication is important in preventing the further growth and spread of the bacteria.\n\n3. Slower death at 60 \u00b0C (140 \u00b0F): Legionella has a slower death rate at lower temperatures. It takes approximately 32 minutes of exposure to a temperature of 60 \u00b0C (140 \u00b0F) to effectively kill the bacteria. This highlights the importance of maintaining higher temperatures for more rapid disinfection.\n\n4. Extended time at 55 \u00b0C (131 \u00b0F): Legionella is less sensitive to temperatures around 55 \u00b0C (131 \u00b0F). In fact, it can take 5 to 6 hours of exposure to this temperature to kill the bacteria.

To understand this concept better, let's use the example of the function f(x) = x^2. We can sketch the graphs of two related functions using this example. \n\nFirst, let's consider the function g(x) = x^2 + 3. Adding 3 to the original function causes a vertical shift upward by 3 units. By applying this transformation, we can plot the graph of g(x) based on the graph of f(x). \n\nNext, let's examine the function h(x) = x^2 - 2. Subtracting 2 from the original function results in a vertical shift downward by 2 units. By implementing this transformation, we can create the graph of h(x) using the graph of f(x) as a starting point. \n\nNow, we will switch to a different example with the function f(x) = x^3 - 9x. Again, we can sketch the graphs of two related functions based on this example. \n\nFirstly, let's consider the function g(x) = x^3 - 9x + 10. Adding 10 to the original function causes a vertical shift upward by 10 units. By applying this transformation, we can plot the graph of g(x) using the graph of f(x) as a reference. \n\nLastly, let's examine the function h(x) = x^3 - 9x - 20. Subtracting 20 from the original function results in a vertical shift downward by 20 units. By implementing this transformation, we can create the graph of h(x) based on the graph of f(x). \n\nIn summary, through these examples, we have showcased how to sketch the graphs of various functions by applying vertical shifting transformations using the original function as a starting point."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 166, "completion_tokens": 377, "total_tokens": 543}}}, "Walking pneumonia (also called atypical pneumonia because it's different from the typical bacterial pneumonia) is common in teens and is often caused by a tiny microorganism, Mycoplasma pneumoniae (pronounced: my-co-PLAZ-ma noo-MO-nee-ay).": {"request": "Please rewrite this passage increasing the number of the terms relevant and true\n\nWalking pneumonia (also called atypical pneumonia because it's different from the typical bacterial pneumonia) is common in teens and is often caused by a tiny microorganism, Mycoplasma pneumoniae (pronounced: my-co-PLAZ-ma noo-MO-nee-ay).", "request_prompt": "2", "gpt-3.5-turbo-response": {"id": "chatcmpl-7veXBuXFG9ALcpYx45wDhyS8Xxrzl", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1693974865, "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo-0613", "choices": [{"index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "Walking pneumonia, known as atypical pneumonia due to its distinction from the typical bacterial form, is frequently experienced by teenagers.

Use power-saving mode: Most smartphones have a power-saving mode that decreases performance, limits background activity, and reduces certain visual effects to save battery power.\n\n5. Avoid extreme temperatures: Exposing your device to extreme heat or cold can impact its battery life. Keep your device in a moderate temperature range for optimal battery performance.\n\n6. Disable unnecessary connectivity features: In addition to turning off Bluetooth, disabling other connectivity features like NFC, mobile data, and hotspot when not in use can help conserve battery.\n\n7.

These fish have the ability to grow up to an impressive size, typically reaching lengths of about 14 inches. This makes them larger than many other goldfish species, adding to their appeal for fish enthusiasts who appreciate a more substantial presence in their aquatic tanks.\n\nIn terms of habitat preferences, Sarasa Comets are known to favor shady areas. While they can tolerate different conditions, they tend to thrive and feel most comfortable in areas that provide them with some shade. This preference could be attributed to their natural habitat in China, where they are likely to encounter sheltered areas with sufficient shade.\n\nAnother interesting trait of Sarasa Comets is their feeding behavior. As omnivorous creatures, they have a diverse diet consisting of both plant matter and small organisms. This allows them to have a wide range of options when it comes to feeding, making them adaptable to different environments and food sources.\n\nOverall, the Sarasa Comet is a fascinating and versatile goldfish variety that has captured the attention of fish enthusiasts worldwide.

A diagnosis is confirmed if at least 20 out of every 100 white blood cells in the bone marrow are blast cells.

Consequently, this leads to fatigue and overall weakness, as a result of anemia. Moreover, AML also affects the production of platelets, which are crucial for blood clotting.

This means that exposing Legionella to these temperatures can help eliminate the bacteria and prevent the spread of Legionnaires' disease.\n\n2. Rapid death at 66 \u00b0C (151 \u00b0F): Legionella bacteria can be effectively killed within 2 minutes when exposed to a temperature of 66 \u00b0C (151 \u00b0F). This quick eradication is important in preventing the further growth and spread of the bacteria.\n\n3. Slower death at 60 \u00b0C (140 \u00b0F): Legionella has a slower death rate at lower temperatures. It takes approximately 32 minutes of exposure to a temperature of 60 \u00b0C (140 \u00b0F) to effectively kill the bacteria. This highlights the importance of maintaining higher temperatures for more rapid disinfection.\n\n4. Extended time at 55 \u00b0C (131 \u00b0F): Legionella is less sensitive to temperatures around 55 \u00b0C (131 \u00b0F). In fact, it can take 5 to 6 hours of exposure to this temperature to kill the bacteria.

To understand this concept better, let's use the example of the function f(x) = x^2. We can sketch the graphs of two related functions using this example. \n\nFirst, let's consider the function g(x) = x^2 + 3. Adding 3 to the original function causes a vertical shift upward by 3 units. By applying this transformation, we can plot the graph of g(x) based on the graph of f(x). \n\nNext, let's examine the function h(x) = x^2 - 2. Subtracting 2 from the original function results in a vertical shift downward by 2 units. By implementing this transformation, we can create the graph of h(x) using the graph of f(x) as a starting point. \n\nNow, we will switch to a different example with the function f(x) = x^3 - 9x. Again, we can sketch the graphs of two related functions based on this example. \n\nFirstly, let's consider the function g(x) = x^3 - 9x + 10. Adding 10 to the original function causes a vertical shift upward by 10 units. By applying this transformation, we can plot the graph of g(x) using the graph of f(x) as a reference. \n\nLastly, let's examine the function h(x) = x^3 - 9x - 20. Subtracting 20 from the original function results in a vertical shift downward by 20 units. By implementing this transformation, we can create the graph of h(x) based on the graph of f(x). \n\nIn summary, through these examples, we have showcased how to sketch the graphs of various functions by applying vertical shifting transformations using the original function as a starting point."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 166, "completion_tokens": 377, "total_tokens": 543}}}, "Walking pneumonia (also called atypical pneumonia because it's different from the typical bacterial pneumonia) is common in teens and is often caused by a tiny microorganism, Mycoplasma pneumoniae (pronounced: my-co-PLAZ-ma noo-MO-nee-ay).": {"request": "Please rewrite this passage increasing the number of the terms relevant and true\n\nWalking pneumonia (also called atypical pneumonia because it's different from the typical bacterial pneumonia) is common in teens and is often caused by a tiny microorganism, Mycoplasma pneumoniae (pronounced: my-co-PLAZ-ma noo-MO-nee-ay).", "request_prompt": "2", "gpt-3.5-turbo-response": {"id": "chatcmpl-7veXBuXFG9ALcpYx45wDhyS8Xxrzl", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1693974865, "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo-0613", "choices": [{"index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "Walking pneumonia, known as atypical pneumonia due to its distinction from the typical bacterial form, is frequently experienced by teenagers.

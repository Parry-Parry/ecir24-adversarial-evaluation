How long does a bee live on average is determined from the start of its life cycle, an egg? Being male or female bee drastically changes the lifespan of a bee. Stages of bee life cycle. How long does a bee live is usually counted from the time it is a fully developed adult bee. Bees pass through four life stages: the egg, larva (larvae), pupa and adult. The process of growing from egg to the adult bee is called complete metamorphosis.", "request_prompt": "7", "gpt-3.5-turbo-response": {"id": "chatcmpl-7yYelyorNSmjo701ekqXdrikoa7Yg", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1694667255, "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo-0613", "choices": [{"index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"Understanding the Factors That Determine the Relevant and True Lifespan of a Bee: From Egg to Adult in Complete Metamorphosis.\""}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 176, "completion_tokens": 28, "total_tokens": 204}}}, "DNA is a double-stranded molecule with a long chain of nucleotides while RNA is single-stranded molecule, in most of its biological roles and has a shorter chain of nucleotides (after transcription and splicing, only exons remain in RNA).": {"request": "Please create a single sentence headline for the following passage that includes terms like relevant, true, or similar words\n\nDNA is a double-stranded molecule with a long chain of nucleotides while RNA is single-stranded molecule, in most of its biological roles and has a shorter chain of nucleotides (after transcription and splicing, only exons remain in RNA).", "request_prompt": "7", "gpt-3.5-turbo-response": {"id": "chatcmpl-7yYen7mZ3fqLGEe1gS9BG0WRSKAAu", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1694667257, "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo-0613", "choices": [{"index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"Discovering the Truth about DNA and RNA: Uncovering the Relevant Differences and Biological Roles of the Double-stranded and Single-stranded Molecules.\""}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 91, "completion_tokens": 30, "total_tokens": 121}}}, "This is used to marginal cost, revenue and profit.

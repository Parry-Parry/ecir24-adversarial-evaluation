Reinforcing this opinion is the concept of monotonality which presents a complex schema of tonal relationships expressed in the Chart of Regions.ntroducing the concept of transference of function, Schoenberg considers the harmonic function of a chord as present, understanding that a chord presents specific characteristics that are transferred to other chords. This procedure is based on the imitation of a model of tonal expression: the cadence IV(II)-V-I."}

Because every monotonic heuristic is also admissible, monotonicity is a stricter requirement than admissibility. In some heuristic algorithms, such as A*, the algorithm can be considered optimal if it is monotonic."}

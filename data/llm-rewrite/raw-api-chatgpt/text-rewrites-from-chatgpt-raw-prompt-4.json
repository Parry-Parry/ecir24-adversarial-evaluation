Pneumonia, a lung infection, can disrupt ventilation-perfusion coupling.\n\nIn pneumonia, the infection can cause inflammation and fluid buildup in the lungs, reducing ventilation and altering the distribution of blood flow. This leads to areas of the lung receiving less air and blood supply, impairing proper gas exchange.\n\nTo simplify, ventilation-perfusion coupling ensures that the right amount of air and blood reach the lung's functional units (alveoli) for efficient gas exchange.
